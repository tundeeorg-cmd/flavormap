# Decision log

Every `[HD]` gate in FlavorMap — the judgment calls that are the project's intellectual
content. Twenty gates, roughly 225 hours (Bible §13).

**This file is not bookkeeping.** It is interview preparation, methods-section source
material, and the single best answer to "how much help did you have?" A student who can
open a dated file and show two hundred documented judgment calls is not answering that
question defensively.

## How to use it

Claude Code may append a **stub** — the gate number, the date, the options presented, and
the consequences of each. **The Decision and Reasoning fields are the researcher's and are
never written by the agent.** A gate with an empty Decision field is an open gate, and no
work proceeds past it.

Format per gate:

```
## HD-n — <short title>
**Date presented:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Options presented:**
  A. …  (consequence: …)
  B. …  (consequence: …)
**Recommendation given:** …
**Decision:**            ← researcher
**Reasoning:**           ← researcher
**Date decided:**        ← researcher
```

Gates are listed in `CLAUDE.md` §9. Numbering there is a proposal reconciled from the v2
plan; confirm it before citing a gate number anywhere external.

## HD-1 — Dialect-group assignment for the 77 provinces
**Date presented:** 2026-08-16
**Status:** OPEN — `provinces.dialect_group` is NULL for all 77 rows and stays that way
until this is decided.

**What depends on it:** RQ1's competing boundary set. Bible §5 RQ1 scope note picks
*linguistic* as the one comparison to run, so this column is the entire alternative
hypothesis. It also feeds `D_lang` in any partial-Mantel table and the upper-vs-lower
Isaan question that Surin was chosen to sit on.

**Options presented:**
  A. Five-way split (Central / Kam Mueang / Isaan-Lao / Dambro-Southern / Malay), assign
     ambiguous provinces to their majority group.
     Consequence: clean categorical variable, one province one label. Boundary provinces
     are misdescribed, and they are exactly where RQ1 looks for a change point.
  B. Five-way split with an explicit `transitional` sixth value for the ambiguous set.
     Consequence: honest, and `transitional` provinces can be reported separately or
     excluded in a sensitivity run. Costs a category that no ethnolinguistic map uses.
  C. Per-province membership weights over the five groups instead of a single label.
     Consequence: most faithful to the linguistic reality and supports a continuous
     `D_lang`. Substantially more work, and no published source gives the weights — they
     would be judgment calls needing individual defence.

**Recommendation given:** B.
**Consequence of choosing otherwise:** A makes the RQ1 result harder to defend precisely
at the boundaries the question is about. C is defensible but adds ~10 hours of sourcing
and turns one gate into fifteen.

**Ambiguous provinces found:** Tak, Phetchaburi, Ratchaburi, Chumphon, Prachuap Khiri
Khan, Uthai Thani, Nakhon Sawan, Phetchabun, Loei, Nakhon Ratchasima, Kanchanaburi,
Satun. Rationale for each is in the session report accompanying this entry.

**Selected: option B** (communicated in session, 2026-08-16).

*Implementation note (machine-written, not a substitute for the fields below).*
Migration `013_dialect_group_taxonomy.sql` adds a CHECK constraint permitting
`Central | Kam_Mueang | Isaan_Lao | Dambro | Malay | Transitional`. NULL remains
permitted — an unassigned province is honest, a wrongly-assigned one is not.
`data/reference/provinces.csv` is populated: Central 26, Isaan_Lao 18, Transitional 12,
Kam_Mueang 9, Dambro 9, Malay 3. **The per-province assignment is a proposal and has not
been reviewed** — see the session report for the three calls most worth checking
(Surin/Si Sa Ket/Buri Ram, Sukhothai/Phitsanulok, Nakhon Ratchasima).

## HD-2 — Land-border definition
**Date presented:** 2026-08-16
**Status:** OPEN — `provinces.border_country` is populated with land borders only, and the
multi-border encoding is provisional.

**What depends on it:** `D_border` in any boundary comparison, and the "border province"
framing in RQ1/RQ3 discussion.

**Two questions, one gate.**

**(a) Does coastal proximity to Malaysia count as a border?**
  A. Land borders only. Satun, Songkhla, Yala, Narathiwat are MY; nothing else.
     Consequence: defensible, matches every official boundary dataset. Excludes Pattani,
     which is culturally continuous with the Malay-speaking south and has obvious
     maritime contact but no land border.
  B. Land borders plus maritime adjacency. Adds Pattani (and arguably Trang, Krabi,
     Phuket for Andaman-side contact).
     Consequence: better matches culinary reality in the deep south. "Maritime adjacency"
     has no standard definition, so the threshold becomes another judgment call to defend.

**Recommendation given:** A, with Pattani noted in the limitations register as a known
case where the administrative definition and the cultural reality diverge.

**(b) How are multi-border provinces encoded?** Chiang Rai borders both Myanmar and Laos;
Ubon Ratchathani borders both Laos and Cambodia. `border_country` is a single TEXT column.
  A. Pipe-delimited string (`MM|LA`) — what the CSV currently holds. Cheap; needs parsing
     everywhere and cannot be indexed or joined cleanly.
  B. `TEXT[]` array via a forward migration. Queryable, indexable, honest about
     cardinality. Costs one migration.
  C. A `province_borders` junction table. Most normalised; heaviest for two rows of data.

**Recommendation given:** B.
**Consequence of choosing otherwise:** A works but every consumer re-implements the split
and one of them will forget. C is correct and disproportionate at n=2.

**Selected: (a) option A, (b) option B** (communicated in session, 2026-08-16).

*Implementation note (machine-written, not a substitute for the fields below).*
(a) Land borders only. Pattani carries no `border_country`; the divergence from cultural
reality is recorded as limitation L17 rather than encoded.
(b) Migration `014_border_country_array.sql` converts `border_country` to `TEXT[]` with a
CHECK against `{LA,KH,MM,MY}` and a GIN index. Chiang Rai and Ubon Ratchathani are the two
multi-border rows. The CSV keeps the pipe-delimited form because CSV has no array type;
`scripts/load_geometry.py` splits on load.
